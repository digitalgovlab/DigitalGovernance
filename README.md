# Digital Governance Lab
*governance of technology and governance through technology*

## What
An interdisciplinary applied teaching, research, and development lab exploring issues related to digital governance, co-created by students and faculty and focused on service to the community. 

## Why
  * Engage students in thinking about digital governance issues including tech regulation, civic technology, algorithmic decision making, AI and the future of work.
  + Prepare students for careers in public interest technology.
  + Produce high quality open research to advise and inform local, state, and federal policymakers on issues of tech regulation and governing with technology.
  + Direct university technology resources to serving our local community and supporting and improving government services for the Charlottesville/Albemarle region.

## How
**Digital Governance Class** co-taught by rotating faculty advisor and student research fellow focusing on engaging students with the ideas and debates of digital governance every semester.

**Digital Governance Innovation Lab** with paid fellows working to produce applied research to meaningfully inform local & state policy to create better technology regulation and better government technology. 

**Annual Digital Governance Summit** bringing together technologists, policymakers, and program officers to talk about the current state and the  future of digital governance

## Structure 
**Board of Advisors:** committed faculty members and administrators providing guidance and oversight to the activities and directions of the Lab.

**Affiliated Faculty:** faculty members with research interests related to the work of the Lab, interested in events, mentoring students, or teaching a semester of the class. 

**Program Director:**  responsible for overseeing the work of the student research fellows, communicating with Board of Advisors and affiliated faculty. 

**Student Fellows:** students working on applied research on regulation or civic technology and/or students working on the development of civic technology.

## Timeline
### One Year Goals
**Digital Governance Class** co-taught by rotating faculty advisor and student research fellow focusing on engaging students with the ideas and debates of digital governance. 

**Speaker Series** on tech regulation and civic technology (3-5 speakers over the course of the year), either distributed across the year or in a symposium. 

### Three Year Goals
**Digital Governance Innovation Lab** with paid fellows working to produce applied research to meaningfully inform local & state policy to create better technology regulation and better government technology. 

**Annual Digital Governance Summit** bringing together technologists, policymakers, and program officers to the university to discuss the current state and the future of digital governance, share innovative ideas, and encourage collaborative solutions. 

**Annual Report** on the state of digital governance and major trends with an overview of the work of the Lab in the last academic year.

### Five Year Goals
**Technologist(s) In-Residence:** 10 month fellowship bringing civic technologist(s) to the university to work on a policy or development project, work with research and development fellows.

**Summer Fellowship** a stipend for students to spend their summer researching digital governance or working for an organization towards a similar end.

### Ten Year Goals
**Minor in Digital Governance:** multiple classes offered explicitly in the digital governance space including a class focused on introducing students to the ideas and principles and a series of classes with a rotating faculty advisor focusing on different areas of digital governance (maybe one semester on technology related to transportation and urban planning, one semester on social media/social networking and the regulation of online speech, one semester on anti-trust and big tech monopolies, etc.), design ethics class for engineers, business ethics class for product managers. CS has way more electives than other engineering minors, this is super doable.

**Alumni Network:** a formalized network for alumni of the lab to connect with and support one another in their digital governance careers
